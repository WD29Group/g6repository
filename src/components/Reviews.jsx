                                    <p><strong>Wellness break</strong></p>
                                    <p>We booked the hotel for our first trip to the beach after the lockdowns. They were
                                        one of maybe just a few that allowed kids and senior citizens. The resort required
                                        covid testing upon arrival and were very strict about this (our driver relates that
                                        he witnessed arrivals being turned away for apparently testing positive). The staff
                                        were very accommodating/helpful and we thought the food was good. The facilities
                                        were well-maintained and enjoyed these as there were few guests at the time. Other
                                        resorts were still closed at the time of our stay so we also practically had the
                                        beach to ourselves.</p>

                                    <p id="HEADING" class="title"><strong>Birthday week</strong></p>
                                    <p>I celebrated my birthday week (4 days ) in Acuatico. It was such a wonderful
                                        experience for me because the staff are all helful and very friendly. Special
                                        mention to Flora, Janice, Ronald and Cezar. These people are so consistent in
                                        giving excellent service. Acuatico should be proud to have them in their crew.
                                        The rooms, and facilities are always kept clean and tidy. The menu was limited
                                        due to covid but when i craved for tortang talong, afritada and spaghetti, they
                                        tried their best to serve it because i wanted to eat it. Overall , my total bday
                                        getaway was a blast! If you see in the pics the dinner presentation they did for
                                        me by the beach, youâ€™ll feel happy too. It was such a nice set up. I really felt
                                        special on my bday. THANK YOU Resort Villas for making my bday celebration Splendid!
                                        We will be back!</p>

                                    <p><strong>Gorgeous view!</strong></p>
                                    <p>We were in Manila for a family wedding and decided to get away from the city
                                        for a couple days. They have an infinity pool that overlooks Tayabas bay
                                        that provides amazing sunrise and sunset views. There are rentals right on
                                        the water and we decided to go snorkeling, which was also a great
                                        experience. We took a small bangka boat on a 20 minute ride to the
                                        snorkeling location which allowed us to se more of the area by water. The
                                        resort has 2 poolside bars that serve food as well as a buffet style setup
                                        for the daily meal services. Would definitely return here again!</p>
